# TLS/SSL configuration for exim as an SMTP server.

# If Exim is compiled with support for TLS, you may want to enable the
# following options so that Exim allows clients to make encrypted
# connections. In the authenticators section below, there are template
# configurations for plaintext username/password authentication. This kind
# of authentication is only safe when used within a TLS connection, so the
# authenticators will only work if the following TLS settings are turned on
# as well.

# Allow any client to use TLS.

# tls_advertise_hosts = *

# Specify the location of the Exim server's TLS certificate and private key.
# The private key must not be encrypted (password protected). You can put
# the certificate and private key in the same file, in which case you only
# need the first setting, or in separate files, in which case you need both
# options.

tls_certificate = CONFDIR/exim.crt
tls_privatekey = CONFDIR/exim.key

# For OpenSSL, prefer EC- over RSA-authenticated ciphers
# tls_require_ciphers = ECDSA:RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT

# In order to support roaming users who wish to send email from anywhere,
# you may want to make Exim listen on other ports as well as port 25, in
# case these users need to send email from a network that blocks port 25.
# The standard port for this purpose is port 587, the "message submission"
# port. See RFC 4409 for details. Microsoft MUAs cannot be configured to
# talk the message submission protocol correctly, so if you need to support
# them you should also allow TLS-on-connect on the traditional but
# non-standard port 465.

# daemon_smtp_ports = 25 : 465 : 587
# tls_on_connect_ports = 465

# Pointer to the CA Certificates against which client certificates are
# checked. This is controlled by the `tls_verify_hosts' and
# `tls_try_verify_hosts' lists below.
# If you want to check server certificates, you need to add an
# tls_verify_certificates statement to the smtp transport.
# /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt is generated by
# the "ca-certificates" package's update-ca-certificates(8) command.

# A list of hosts which are constrained by `tls_verify_certificates'. A host
# that matches `tls_verify_host' must present a certificate that is
# verifyable through `tls_verify_certificates' in order to be accepted as an
# SMTP client. If it does not, the connection is aborted.
#
# tls_verify_hosts = *

# A weaker form of checking: if a client matches `tls_try_verify_hosts' (but
# not `tls_verify_hosts'), request a certificate and check it against
# `tls_verify_certificates' but do not abort the connection if there is no
# certificate or if the certificate presented does not match. (This
# condition can be tested for in ACLs through `verify = certificate')
# By default, this check is done for all hosts. It is known that some
# clients (including incredimail's version downloadable in February
# 2008) choke on this.
